# Task 1
# Iris Flowers Classification ML Project :
This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.

# Task 2
# Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM
LSTMs are widely used for sequence prediction problems and have proven to be extremely effective. The reason they work so well is that LSTM can store past important information and forget the information that is not. LSTM has three gates: The input gate: The input gate adds information to the cell state, The forget gate: It removes the information that is no longer required by the model, The output gate: Output Gate at LSTM selects the information to be shown as output.While Implementing any LSTM, we should always reshape our X train in 3-D, add 1 the reason behind is the time step and the 1 is given to the LSTM.

# Task 3
# Music Recommendation:
Music recommender systems can suggest songs to users based on their listening patterns.KKBOX provides a training data set consists of information of the first observable listening event for each unique user-song pair within a specific time duration. Metadata of each unique user and song pair is also provided. The use of public data to increase the level of accuracy of your prediction is encouraged.

# Task 4
# Image to Pencil Sketch with Python:
We need to read the image in RBG format and then convert it to a grayscale image. This will turn an image into a classic black and white photo. Then the next thing to do is invert the grayscale image also called negative image, this will be our inverted grayscale image. Inversion can be used to enhance details. Then we can finally create the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image. This can be done by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image. Since images are just arrays, we can easily do this programmatically using the divide function from the cv2 library in Python
